1. Overview
-----------
Query2XML allows you to transform the records retrieved with
one or more SQL SELECT queries into XML data. Very simple to
highly complex transformations are supported. Is was written
with performance in mind and can handel large amounts of data.

Another thing you will find useful is Query2XML's capabilities
of Profiling and Performance Tuning.

                          named testCases.sh; all will be installed in
                          $PHP_PEAR_TEST_DIR/XML_Query2XML/tests. Please
                          see 3. Testing.


3. Testing
----------
After installation $PHP_PEAR_TEST_DIR/XML_Query2XML/tests will contain
the following files:
- Query2XMLTest.php ................. 3 unit tests that do not require
                                      any database abstraction layer to
                                      be present
- Query2XMLTestDB.php ............... 68 unit tests that require PEAR DB
- Query2XMLTestMDB2.php ............. 71 unit tests that require PEAR MDB2
- Query2XMLTestADOdb.php ............ 70 unit tests that require ADOdb
- Query2XMLTestADOdbPEAR.php ........ 70 unit tests that require ADOdb which
                                      is using PEAR_Error for error handling
- Query2XMLTestADOdbException.php ... 70 unit tests that require ADOdb which
                                      is using exceptions for error handling
- ISO9075MapperTest.php ............. 26 unit tests fot the class
                                      XML_Query2XML_ISO9075Mapper
- testCases.sh ........... special test script; see below
- Query2XML_Tests.sql .... The SQL DDL required to run Query2XMLTest.php
                           and testCases.sh

*.php test files can be run like this:
``phpunit Query2XMLTest.php''
For complex test cases, an MD5 hash will be generated for all the
XML data. Such a test will fail if the generated MD5 hash does not
match the MD5 hash defined in the test case. To find out what really
went wrong, use testCases.sh.

To get Query2XMLTestDB.php, Query2XMLTestMDB2.php or Query2XMLTestADOdb*.php
working, you will have to change the the default DSN
mysql://root@localhost/Query2XML_Tests within the files.

ISO9075MapperTest.php can be run like this:
``phpunit ISO9075MapperTest.php''

testCases.sh is a very useful bash script that will compare the
generated XML data with the test cases in $PHP_PEAR_DOC_DIR.
Run it from the directory $PHP_PEAR_TEST_DIR/XML_Query2XML/tests:
./testCases.sh


4. ChangeLog
------------
Beginning with v0.6.0 the development of XML_Query2XML was moved from sourceforge.net
to cvs.php.net. Therefore you will find two ChangeLog files:

ChangeLog-until-v0.6.0 ....... ChangeLog entries from cvs.sourceforge.net
                               (until v0.6.0)
