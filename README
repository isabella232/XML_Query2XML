highly complex transformations are supported. Is was written
with performance in mind and can handel large amounts of data.

Another thing you will find useful is Query2XML's capabilities
of Profiling and Performance Tuning.

+---XML ................. CONTAINS THE ACTUAL Query2XML.php that
|                         will be installed in $PHP_PEAR_INSTALL_DIR/XML/
+---tests ............... contains 168 unit tests and a special test script
                          named testCases.sh; all will be installed in
                          $PHP_PEAR_TEST_DIR/XML_Query2XML/tests. Please
                          see 3. Testing.


3. Testing
----------
After installation $PHP_PEAR_TEST_DIR/XML_Query2XML/tests will contain
the following files:
- Query2XMLTest.php ...... 142 unit tests for the class XML_Query2XML
- ISO9075MapperTest.php .. 26 unit tests fot the class
                           XML_Query2XML_ISO9075Mapper
- testCases.sh ........... special test script; see below
- Query2XML_Tests.sql .... The SQL DDL required to run Query2XMLTest.php
                           and testCases.sh

Query2XMLTest.php can be run like this:
``phpunit Query2XMLTest.php''
For complex test cases, an MD5 hash will be generated for all the
XML data. Such a test will fail if the generated MD5 hash does not
match the MD5 hash defined in the test case. To find out what really
went wrong, use testCases.sh.

To get Query2XMLTest.php working, you will have to change the
the default DSN mysql://root@localhost/Query2XML_Tests within the file.

ISO9075MapperTest.php can be run like this:
``phpunit ISO9075MapperTest.php''

testCases.sh is a very useful bash script that will compare the
generated XML data with the test cases in $PHP_PEAR_DOC_DIR.
Run it from the directory $PHP_PEAR_TEST_DIR/XML_Query2XML/tests:
./testCases.sh
