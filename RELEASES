Public Releases of Query2XML
============================
Version: $Id$


v0.7.0
------
Release date: 2006-10-14
Release notes:
This release adds support for ADOdb (adodb.sf.net).
ADOdb can be used with different error handling mechanisms:
- default: methods return false on failure; these errors
  will be caught by XML_Query2XML and an XML_Query2XML_DBException
  will be thrown
- PEAR_Error: methods return PEAR_Error on failure (or false
  and require ADODB_Pear_Error() to be called);
  XML_Query2XML will catch these errors and throw an
  XML_Query2XML_DBException that contains the information provided
  by the PEAR_Error instance.
- exceptions: if an ADODB_Exception is thrown by ADOdb
  XML_Query2XML will catch it and throw an XML_Query2XML_DBException

This means that no matter which error handling mechanism is used within
ADOdb, XML_Query2XML will behave the same. It will throw an
XML_Query2XML_DBException in case of a database error.

v0.6.1
------
Release date: 2006-09-28
Release notes:
This release fixes a minor bug with PHP5 prior to 5.1.0.
Thanks a lot to Christophe Laratte <christophe dot laratte at openflyers dot org>;
for reporting this!

Bug fixes:
- Fixed Bug #8799 "DB/common.php required": compatibility fix for
  PHP5 &lt; 5.1.0: added class_exists() calls before using instanceof
  operator in XML_Query2XML constructor;
  see also: http://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=29736

v0.6.0
------
Release date: 2006-04-23
Release notes:
This release includes all changes recommeded during the PEPr voting process.
Major changes:
- asterisk shortcut that expands to all columns in the result set;
  the tutorial was updated to document this feature and a new
  case study (case 07) was added to provide a good example
- implementation of ISO/IEC 9075-14:2005 for mapping SQL identifiers to
  XML names; the tutorial was updates to document this feature and
  a new case study (case 08) was added to provide lots of examples
- new complex attribute specifications (from my own wish list)

Minor changes:
- simplification of the inner workings of the methods _hasDOMChild()
  and _getDOMChild()
- using foreach($array as $key => $value) instead of
  while(list($key, $value) = each($array))
- now comes with 168 unit tests

v0.5.1
------
Release date: 2006-03-17
Release notes:
This release includes a couple of minor changes:
- all lines now have a maximum length of 85 characters
- no () with require_once
- always using {} with code blocks
- no silencing of any calls using @
- using /* ... */ for all multi-line comments
- enhanced documentation for private methods
- code enhancements inside XML_Query2XML::getXML()

v0.5.0
------
Release date: 2006-03-14
Release notes:
This release includes a couple of major changes:
- full MDB2 support
- all new exception handling: just three different
  exceptions that all extend XML_Query2XML_Exception.
- now comes with 99 PHPUnit2 unit tests
- every exception that is thrown or bubbles up is
  documented in the API-docs; the tutorial has a
  new "Exception Handling" section.
This release implements all recommendations made by
PEAR developers during a first proposal.

Minor changes include:
- using ' instead of " where-ever possible
- as PHP5 uses references for objects by default & (such as
  in =&) is now only used where necessary.
- the tutorial now renders just fine in all common browsers

v0.4.0
------
Release date: 2006-02-28
Release notes:
This release includes one major change:
- Public methods will now only throw exceptions that extend PEAR_Exception.
  No PEAR errors or special XML will be returned anymore.
  Therefore the public method XML_Query2XML::factory() now
  only knows one argument.

v0.3.0
------
Release date: 2006-02-25
Release notes:
This release includes two major changes:
- XML_Query2XML now uses PHP5's DOM XML extension. Therefore
  DomDocument, DomNode, etc are now used in favor of XML_Query2XML_XMLElement.
  XML_Query2XML does not come with XML_Query2XML_XMLElement anymore!
- Back to the roots! XML_Query2XML concentrates on its core features and
  therefore drops the functionality of generating an XML schema from XML data.

Minor changes:
- reduction of unit tests (fewer public methods to test): 20
- complete review of the tutorial and the API documentation
- changes of testCases.sh: schema validation is not supported
  anymore


v0.2.0
------
Release date: 2006-02-08
Release notes:
The first public release v0.2.0 is available! 
Just download the package and run `pear install <package_file>'.
Alternatively you can also directly run
`pear install http://query2xml.sourceforge.net/releases/XML_Query2XML-0.2.0.tgz'. 

This release includes 
- in-depth documentation: tutorials and API documentation
- 6 case studies: from very simple to highly complex scenarios
- 104 unit tests for PHPUnit
- minor bug fixes
- development was moved to sourceforge's CVS server
